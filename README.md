# firstwebsideofdunc

This project represents my first foray into web development and HTML coding. I began working on it on June 2, 2022 as a way to teach myself the foundations of HTML through hands-on practice.

The code and site were developed entirely by me, without the use of templates or borrowed code. My learning resources were primarily the HTML tutorials and reference materials provided by w3schools.com.

As my inaugural coding project, the site is relatively simple but gave me essential experience in:

HTML document structure (DOCTYPE, head, body, etc)
Basic HTML tags for text formatting, lists, links, images, etc.
Using HTML tables to organize tabular data
Embedding media like videos and PDFs
HTML forms and form inputs
Page structure and layout with <div> elements
Hosting static web pages
Though rudimentary compared to professional sites, this project represents an important first step for me in building real-world skills in web development. I'm proud of having taught myself HTML fundamentals through creating this site from scratch. Moving forward I'm excited to continue growing as a coder by learning java and php.
